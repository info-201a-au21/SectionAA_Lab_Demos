# Reflection 1


## Create an unordered list of what you like about the starbucks datatset

* I like it because its unique dataset
* It continue valubale information
* It makes me think twice or make decisions better based on the data







----------------------------------------------------------


## Reflection 2:
### Type a pargraph with at least a bold some italics explaining why you find the datatset intersting.


I found the dataset _intersting_ because **I don't drink starbucks** but this dataset gave me some good insights as to what I can expect from
Starbucks including Fats in what types of food and the total number of fats for example and many more.
